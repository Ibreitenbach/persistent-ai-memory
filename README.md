## 🗽 Built for All Americans - FREE Forever 🦅

**🔴⚪🔵 Access to Justice is a Fundamental Right 🔴⚪🔵**

</div>

**We are a nation of immigrants.** From every corner of the world, people have come to America bringing their cultures, languages, and dreams. This project celebrates that heritage.

### 💡 [Read Our Mission Statement](MISSION.md)

### 🇺🇸 Standing for American Values & The Rule of Law

**This tool embodies what America should stand for:**

We believe in the **rule of law** and **constitutional rights**. This tool helps people:
- ✅ **Understand and follow legal immigration pathways** (not circumvent them)
- ✅ **Exercise their constitutional rights** (free speech, due process, legal representation)
- ✅ **Access the justice system fairly** (not be exploited by lack of knowledge)
- ✅ **Navigate the legal system properly** (with accurate information)

**The Real Problem We're Addressing:**

For too long, **profit-driven interests** have gatekept access to legal information:
- $3,000-$15,000 attorney fees create barriers to justice
- Expensive legal databases lock away public court decisions
- Lack of accessible information leaves families vulnerable to exploitation
- Predatory services take advantage of confusion and fear

**This is fundamentally un-American.** Legal information is public. Court decisions are public. The law belongs to the people.

**What Makes This Patriotic:**

This tool stands up for:
- 🗽 **Constitutional rights for all** - enshrined in our founding documents
- ⚖️ **Equal access to justice** - a cornerstone of American democracy
- 📜 **Rule of law** - by helping people understand and follow it correctly
- 🦅 **American heritage** - we are a nation built by immigrants
- 💪 **Standing against exploitation** - profit should not gate access to justice

**We Support:**
- Legal immigration pathways (family, employment, humanitarian protection)
- Constitutional protections during enforcement encounters
- Qualified immigration attorneys providing personalized legal advice
- The legal system functioning fairly for everyone

**We Oppose:**
- Gatekeeping public legal information behind paywalls
- Exploiting vulnerable families through lack of accessible information
- Profit-driven barriers to understanding the law
- Any actions that undermine the rule of law

**This is not about evading law enforcement.** This is about **upholding American values** by ensuring everyone can access legal information, understand their rights, and navigate the legal system properly.

**Access to justice is not terrorism. It's democracy.**

---

**Why this tool is FREE and why it matters NOW:**
- During times of ICE enforcement, knowledge is power
- Legal information should not be a privilege for the wealthy
- Understanding your rights protects families
- Legal immigration pathways exist - we make them clear
- Access to justice is a fundamental right

**This tool provides:**
- ✅ FREE access to federal immigration case law
- ✅ Know Your Rights information
- ✅ Legal pathways clearly explained
- ✅ Connection to pro bono legal services
- ✅ Zero cost forever - no paywalls, no barriers

Whether your family came on the Mayflower, through Ellis Island, across the Rio Grande, from Asia, Africa, Europe, or the Americas—**you belong here.** This technology is built **by** immigrants, **for** immigrants, and for **all Americans** who believe in the strength of our diversity.

**We welcome contributors** from every background:
- 🇲🇽 🇨🇳 🇮🇳 🇵🇭 🇻🇳 🇰🇷 🇯🇵 🇹🇭 Asian & Pacific Islander Americans
- 🇲🇽 🇨🇺 🇵🇷 🇨🇴 🇩🇴 🇸🇻 🇬🇹 🇭🇳 Latino & Hispanic Americans
- 🇳🇬 🇪🇹 🇰🇪 🇬🇭 🇿🇦 African & Black Americans
- 🇮🇹 🇵🇱 🇩🇪 🇮🇪 🇬🇷 🇫🇷 European Americans
- 🏳️‍🌈 LGBTQ+ Americans
- ✊🏽 Indigenous & Native Americans
- 🕊️ Muslim, Jewish, Christian, Hindu, Buddhist, Sikh, and all faith traditions

**America's greatest strength is our diversity.** This project is open-source, bilingual (English/Spanish, with more languages welcome), and committed to making AI technology accessible to **everyone**.

### 🤝 Claude Code: Your Personal Immigration Research Advocate

**Unlike generic legal databases, Claude Code with Legal Hub becomes YOUR advocate:**

**Learns Your Unique Situation:**
- Remembers your family structure (spouse, children, parents)
- Tracks your immigration history (visas, applications, denials)
- Understands your timeline (how long in U.S., deadlines)
- Recalls your specific concerns (employment, school, healthcare)

**Remembers Every Step of Your Journey:**
- **Session 1:** You explain your situation → Claude learns and stores it
- **Session 2 (weeks later):** Claude remembers everything from Session 1
- **Session 10:** Claude has built comprehensive understanding of your case
- **Session 50:** Claude knows your entire immigration story

**Builds Personalized Knowledge:**
```
Your conversation history gets stored with pheromone scores:
- Questions you asked → remembered (score: 12.5)
- Forms you're working on → prioritized (score: 15.0)
- Deadlines you mentioned → tracked (score: 18.5)
- Resources that helped you → boosted for future sessions (score: 16.2)
```

**Example: How This Helps You**

**Traditional legal research (every session starts from zero):**
```
You: "I need help with my I-485"
System: "What's your situation?" ← Asks every time
You: ← Explain everything again ← Waste time repeating
```

**Claude Code with Legal Hub (learns and remembers):**
```
Session 1:
You: "I'm on H-1B, married to U.S. citizen, want green card"
Claude: ← Learns your situation ← Stores in memory

Session 2 (2 weeks later):
You: "What documents do I need for I-485?"
Claude: "Based on your H-1B status and USC spouse (from our last talk),
         you'll need..." ← Already knows your situation!

Session 5 (1 month later):
You: "My priority date just became current!"
Claude: "Great! Since you're in the U.S. on H-1B with USC spouse,
         you can file I-485 immediately. Remember we discussed the
         medical exam - have you scheduled that?"
         ← Remembers your entire journey!
```

**Privacy & Security:**
- All memory stored **locally** on your machine
- No cloud uploads of your personal information
- You control your data (delete anytime)
- Open source - verify exactly what gets stored

**This Is Like Having:**
- A paralegal who remembers everything about your case
- A research assistant who tracks all your deadlines
- A guide who knows your entire immigration story
- Available 24/7, for $0, that never forgets

**See Full Guide:** [Immigration Law Guide](examples/legal-research/IMMIGRATION_LAW_GUIDE.md)

**IMPORTANT:** Legal Hub provides legal **information**, not legal **advice**. Claude Code is a research tool that learns your situation to help you find relevant information faster. Always consult with a qualified immigration attorney for your specific case.

## What Is This?

A complete system for AI conversational memory that:
- ✅ Loads filtered history **once** at session start
- ✅ Answers queries with **0ms retrieval latency**
- ✅ Uses **pheromone learning** to prioritize useful memories
- ✅ **Battle-tested** with 4,994+ real conversations

## Why Preload > RAG?

**Traditional RAG Systems** (Mem0, MemGPT):
- Retrieve on EVERY query → 150-1,440ms latency
- Partial context → missed connections
- Cumulative cost → $0.01-0.10 per query

**Preload Architecture** (RLM + Mempheromone):
- Load once per session → 0ms query latency
- Full filtered context → complete understanding
- Zero marginal cost → unlimited queries

**For a 10-query conversation:**
- RAG: 1.5-14 seconds of retrieval time
- Preload: 0 seconds (already in context!)

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Ibreitenbach/Legal-Claw-RLMemory
cd Legal-Claw-RLMemory

# 2. Setup database
./scripts/setup.sh

# 3. Install RLM plugin
cp -r rlm-plugin ~/.claude/plugins/rlm-mempheromone

# 4. Start using - memory automatically loads!
```

## Production Results

**Real Usage** (4,994 conversations):
- Session load: 1.5 MB (27,036 lines)
- Context size: ~50K tokens (fits in 200K window)
- Query latency: 0ms (already in context)
- Retrieval failures: 0 (impossible - it's all there!)

**Benchmarks** (50 queries):
- Hybrid RRF: P@5 = 0.144 (+80% improvement)
- Average latency: 21ms
- Cost: $0 (self-hosted)

**Membox** (Topic-Continuous Memory):
- 755 memory boxes with trace links
- Automatic background processing
- Pheromone-based quality learning

## Components

### 1. RLM Plugin (Session Awakening)
- Triggers on session start
- Loads high-quality memories (pheromone >= 10)
- Exports ~50K tokens to context
- Zero query latency after load

### 2. Mempheromone Database
- PostgreSQL + pgvector
- Pheromone scores (RL-trained quality signals)
- Topic-continuous memory boxes (membox)
- Citation graphs and trace links

### 3. Membox (Topic-Continuous Memory)
- Groups related memories by topic
- Links across topic boundaries via events
- Navigable memory structure
- Automatic background processing

### 4. Database Management Tools
- Health monitoring and statistics
- Quality analysis and cleanup
- Embedding regeneration
- Performance optimization

## Performance Comparison

| Metric | RLM+Mempheromone | Mem0 | MemGPT |
|--------|------------------|------|---------|
| Query Latency | **0ms** | 1,440ms | 150ms |
| 10-Query Conv. | **0ms** | 14,400ms | 1,500ms |
| Context Quality | Full history | Top-K | Top-K |
| Retrieval Failures | **0** | Possible | Possible |
| Cost per Query | **$0** | $0.10 | $0.05 |

## When To Use This

**Use Preload When:**
- ✅ Session-based conversations
- ✅ Need full context understanding
- ✅ Want zero retrieval latency
- ✅ Context fits in window (~50K tokens)
- ✅ Self-hosted deployment

**Use RAG When:**
- ⚠️ One-off queries (no session)
- ⚠️ Context too large for window (>100K tokens)
- ⚠️ Dynamic corpus (changes during session)

## Requirements

- PostgreSQL 14+ with pgvector extension
- Python 3.9+
- Claude Code CLI (for RLM plugin)
- ~50K tokens of available context window
